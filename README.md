   ```

   This will install the `sphinx_book_theme` package, which is used to handle the rendering of the RST files.

## Building the Documentation

Once the requirements are installed, you can build the documentation using Sphinx. To build the documentation, run the following command:

make uploaddocs
```

This commands will first clean HTML and other files under the directory `kosmos` if previously `make uploaddocs` was performed. After that it will generate the HTML files for the documentation in the `kosmos` directory.
